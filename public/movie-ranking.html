 <h1>The Best Movies According to Olivia</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
 <p>Elle Woods is very ND coded and I love the way she knows what she wants and goes for it.</p>
 
 <h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
 <p>A moving story about how the love of family, however unconventional, can overcome any challenge.</p>
 
 <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
 <p>A reminder that sometimes naivety and simplicity are the best way to get where you're supposed to be.</p>
